# BitGo Coins Team Interview Project for Andy Mpondo

Congratulations! You have been given 10 Testnet Stellar Lumens, and your task is to send 8.5 TXLM back to us using the return address and memo id below.

Here's the transaction: https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/540deeacd9bfbc17a37c9185d182142ee23adf760b41b7df7a4376ffb5842ce3

The address and memo id to send them back to is `GCFW3WDOYTJSKXDUXNV6QVRUP4WF7GAAOBZ3FI37K42OJW65VYSONKG6?memoId=17`.

Oh, you'll also need the private key. That's encrypted in a file called `private-key.gpg` with a passphrase that you'll get via email.

You may find [stellar-sdk](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk) useful, but feel free to use any tools you like.

Good Luck!
